I discover music on a regular basis. I like to keep a running list to dive back into - it makes my brain feel funny. Here are the lists on a year-by-year basis. Starting 2021, I'm going to throw in youtube links - though I can't guarantee that they're active when you're reading this.

Songs within the lists are ordered as oldest discovery first.

In some lists, entries indicate date of re-discovery of a song. I want to state for the record that 2017 was NOT when I first heard All I want to be (is by your side) by Peter Frampton.
